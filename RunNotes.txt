# This is how I have start to run things out of the docker container.
# they are almost certainly not the correct way to do things

# here is how to start docker when my latop starts
sudo systemctl start docker

# here is how to check for the container name
sudo docker ps -a

# creating the correct image from the cuda docker file
sudo docker build -f /drives/main/Developement/CUDATestGround/CUDADockerFile . -t fedora/cudaimage:v0.1

# command to run created image
sudo docker run -ti -v /usr/local/cuda-9.0:/usr/local/cuda-9.0 fedora/cudaimage:v0.1 /bin/sh

# command to copy compiled files out of a container into current path
sudo docker cp ${container_name}:/docker/path/to/file .

# compile with cuda compiler and create executable
/usr/local/cuda-9.0/bin/nvcc test.cu -o driver

# use rpm fusion for correct nvidia driver installs

# TODO
look up how to delete images and containers

#Thoughts
I need to figure out a first project to use with the cuda compiler
Things I want this project to use since I feel they will help my resume
and growth
1. CUDA (obviously)
2. MT capability
3. good object-oriented architecture
4. templetization
5. SWIG (maybe)

Project ideas
1. Something CFD related
2. Something machine learning related
3. what else is there?

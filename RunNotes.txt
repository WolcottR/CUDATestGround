# creating the correct image from the cuda docker file
sudo docker build -f /drives/main/Developement/CUDATestGround/CUDADockerFile . -t fedora/cudaimage:v0.1

# command to run created image
sudo docker run -ti -v /usr/local/cuda-9.0:/usr/local/cuda-9.0 fedora/cudaimage:v0.1 /bin/sh

# command to copy compiled files out of a container into current path
sudo docker cp ${container_name}:/docker/path/to/file .

# compile with cuda compiler and create executable
/usr/local/cuda-9.0/bin/nvcc test.cu -o driver
